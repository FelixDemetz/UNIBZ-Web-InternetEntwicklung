# Project Template - Web and Internet Engineering (WIE) 2022 @ UniBZ

## Getting started

This template consists of a frontend and a backend component, which are organized in two separate folders, and implements a simple address book web-app.

The frontend is written in ReactJS and consists of a simple one-page web-interface for creating, updating and deleting entries of the address book.

The backend is written in NodeJS and stores the address book in a SQLite database.

This project was tested using node version v12.22.11

## Backend

All required modules are defined in `package.json`. You can install them using

	`npm install`

You can start the backend using

	`npm start`

## Frontend

All required modules are defined in `package.json`. You can install them using

	`npm install`

You can start the frontend using 

	`npm start`

and build the app for production using

	`npm run build`

This command builds to the `build` folder and optimizes the build for production mode.
